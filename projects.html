            <h3>My Eagle Project</h3>
            <h4>I was responsible for the project every step of the way, from the proposal stage through completion. The first step was to design the project with the benefactor, which is a home for the elderly called Gospel of Life Dwelling (GOLD). The project was a vegetable and flower garden consisting of several raised beds, for the residents’ use and benefit. After design, I developed a work plan, which included details regarding the design, tools, materials, safety precautions, and so forth. I presented the work plan to the Eagle District and secured approval. After approval, I lined up volunteers from my Scout Venture Crew (Crew 2021) and my friend group, and then provided them with detailed instructions. On the day of the project, I oversaw each step of the process, assigning individual volunteers to appropriate tasks, and supervising the overall project from the first step to the last. The project was successfully completed in one day.</h4>
